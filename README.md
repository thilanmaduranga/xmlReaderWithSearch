# xmlReaderWithSearch
from this controller you can read xml files in a directory and pass the results to view. NOTE: all the xml entity formats are according to the propertysuite application. (http://www.propertysuite.co.nz/)

# Usage
you can connect your codeigniter web application to the property suite application. and do a proper Search with pagination

# Current status
Still under construction, but it works perfect!

# points to be noted
I have used GOTO statement in this code just for the testing!. now i'm working hard for a better version.
